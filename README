amplayd - Daemon to play movies on an ARCADEmini

Blinkenlights Arcade was a light installation at the
Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris in 2002, realized
by the Chaos Computer Club. See
http://www.blinkenlights.de/arcade/index.en.html

ARCADEmini is a custom hardware project to create small
replicas of the installation using LEDs. See
http://arcademini.schuermans.info/

The amplayd plays animations on this hardware in standalone
operation. This package is only useful if you have such a
device.

We use it for our installation "BlinkenKuze".
