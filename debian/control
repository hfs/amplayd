Description: Daemon to play movies on an ARCADEmini
 Blinkenlights Arcade was a light installation at the
 Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris in 2002, realized
 by the Chaos Computer Club. See
 http://www.blinkenlights.de/arcade/index.en.html
 .
 ARCADEmini is a custom hardware project to create small
 replicas of the installation using LEDs. See
 http://arcademini.schuermans.info/
 .
 The amplayd plays animations on this hardware in standalone
 operation. This package is only useful if you have such a
 device.
